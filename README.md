# Multimodal AI Analytics

A collection of four AI/ML projects focusing on multimodal feature extraction and analysis â€” integrating computer vision, speech processing, and natural language understanding for actionable business insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains implementations and experiments relevant to **"Iâ€™m Beside You Inc."**-style multimodal analytics.  
Each project is designed to work independently but can be combined into a unified pipeline.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. Lightweight Facial Emotion Recognition (Low-Resolution Robust)
- **Goal:** Develop a CNN-based facial emotion recognition model optimized for low-resolution inputs.
- **Skills Used:** Computer Vision (PyTorch/TensorFlow), Data Preprocessing, Model Optimization.
- **Applications:** Real-time emotion analysis in video calls and low-bandwidth environments.
- **Folder:** `/facial-emotion-recognition`

### 2. Voice Feature Extraction & Sentiment Analysis
- **Goal:** Extract audio features (MFCCs, pitch, tone) and classify sentiment.
- **Skills Used:** Speech Processing, Librosa, PyTorch, Signal Processing.
- **Applications:** Detect engagement/mood from call recordings.
- **Folder:** `/voice-sentiment-analysis`

### 3. Text Transcript NLP Insights
- **Goal:** Analyze conversation transcripts for sentiment, engagement level, and topic modeling.
- **Skills Used:** NLP (Transformers, BERT), Text Classification, Topic Modeling.
- **Applications:** Customer support call quality analysis, mental health monitoring.
- **Folder:** `/text-transcript-nlp`

### 4. Multimodal Data Fusion & Correlation with Business KPIs
- **Goal:** Integrate results from facial, voice, and text analysis with external business data to find correlations.
- **Skills Used:** Data Engineering, Pandas, Big Data Processing, Statistical Analysis.
- **Applications:** Predict employee satisfaction, patient mental health status.
- **Folder:** `/multimodal-business-insights`
